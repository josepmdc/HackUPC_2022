# Inspiration
The main motivation of the hackathon has been to create some innovative, creative and intense project in a short a mount of time. All the sponsors have inspired us with great ideas but we were inclined towards MundiMoto.

## What it does
We created a web app with the goal to find a new business model for the company. The main idea was to build a website where you could subscribe, and find the best motorbikes for your location and your requirements. Depending on where you live and where you want to go, you will have a list of possible motorbikes to rent. 
The program is based on a subscription model where the user paying 10â‚¬ will have some freedom to take a motorbike.

## How we built it
The application has been developed using DJango Framework. We also have used Postgres for the database integration. Furthermore, we have called the Stripe API to generate a payment method. 

## Challenges we ran
In this case it has been the first time for the whole team to work with DJango, which has been a challenged than expected.  Also was the first time to implement a payment method which has helped the website to grow exponentially  ( FROM ZERO TO HERO ). 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud to present a website that can help a company to make a significantly amount of money thanks to us. ( BALL IN YOUR COURT)

## What's next for MundiMoto Sharing
As we have said, MundiMoto Sharing is a web app that proposes a new business plan for motorcycle rental. On the other hand, it could be greatly improved in several ways, for example, using interactive maps so that the client can experience a visual interface. Also, it could be improved at the database model level. The reason for choosing to develop the web app in DJango is mainly because it is easy to scale and modify.
